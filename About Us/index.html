            <p>Well, we help recycle. Bottle Depot was initially founded on the foundations of recycling and ecocity.
                Bottle depots, a system already set up and managed by the government was not being fully made use of and
                that was what caught the attention of our development and design team. </p>

                    The main feature of this web application is actually the calculator. Not a simple, daily use
                    calculator, but one that calculates how much you will save in terms of deposits and incentives. An
                    easy to use application that will inform you and teach you more about the values of recycling is our
                    purpose.

                    Our design team decided that a mini game will be the best possible solution to keep the user
                    interested and interact with the act of recycling. By implicitly encouraging green environmental
                    acts, we will be designing a simple matching game for users and clients to enjoy and learn.

                    <p>
                        As project manager, I held responsible for handing in assignments and tasks on time and made
                        sure they were of certain quality. Encouraging other members to stick to the schedule of the
                        sprints, our team really managed to pull through in terms of bringing Bottle Buddies to life. I
                        also contributed by acting as front-end developer and was in charge of the depot locator as well
                        as the about us page of the web application.
